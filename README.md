## Enhancing Visual Perception in Novel Environments via Incremental Data Augmentation Based on Style Transfer
Abhibha Gupta, Rully Agus Hendrawan, Mansur Arief

The deployment of autonomous robots in real-world scenarios is challenged by "unknown unknowns," unexpected situations not encountered during training, such as degraded signs. While existing research focuses on anomaly detection and class imbalances, they often fall short of addressing truly novel scenarios. Our study utilized advanced data augmentation techniques leveraging neural style transfer to effectively enrich underrepresented data. We employed the Variational Prototyping Encoder (VPE) to adeptly identify and handle novel inputs. By comparing models trained solely on original datasets with those trained on a combination of original and augmented datasets, we observed a notable improvement in the performance of the latter. This underscores the critical role of data augmentation in enhancing model robustness. Our findings support the integration of generative models as domain-specific augmentation strategies.
